# AppsAnalyzer 📱
Version 100
AppsAnalyzer is a powerful Android application built with **Jetpack Compose** that scans your device's installed applications and analyzes their underlying technology. It helps developers and enthusiasts identify which apps are built using **Flutter**, **React Native**, **Expo**, **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMM)**, or standard **Native** Android development.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Smart Analysis**: Automatically detects framework signatures inside APKs:
  - **Flutter**: Identifies `libflutter.so`, `flutter_assets`, etc.
  - **React Native**: Detects `libreactnativejni.so`, `index.android.bundle`, etc.
  - **Expo**: Recognizes Expo modules and libraries.
  - **KMM**: Checks for Kotlin Multiplatform shared logic.
  - **Native**: Identifies apps using standard Android SDKs.
- **📊 Statistics Dashboard**: Visual breakdown of installed apps by technology.
- **🔎 Advanced Search & Filtering**: Quickly find apps by name or filter by specific frameworks (e.g., show only Flutter apps).
- **⚡ Modern UI/UX**: Built entirely with Jetpack Compose using Material 3 design principles.
- **💾 Offline Caching**: Uses Room database to cache analysis results for instant loading.
- **🚀 Performance**: Efficient background analysis using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- **UI Framework**: [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) (Material 3)
- **Architecture**: MVVM + Clean Architecture
- **Dependency Injection**: [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
- **Local Database**: [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)
- **Concurrency**: Coroutines & Flow
- **Analysis Logic**: Custom `ZipFile` analysis to inspect APK contents and `AndroidManifest.xml`.

## 📱 How It Works

AppsAnalyzer inspects the internal structure of installed APKs without requiring root access. It looks for specific markers:

- **Flutter**: Presence of Flutter engine libraries and asset structures.
- **React Native**: JavaScript bundles and Hermes/JSC binaries.
- **Expo**: Expo-specific native modules.
- The app uses a scoring system to accurately categorize apps, minimizing false positives.
